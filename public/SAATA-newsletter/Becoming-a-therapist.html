                  <strong>Gunjan Zutsi</strong></div>
                  <p><strong>My experience of CTA exam process</strong></p>
                <p>Here I was, sitting in front of  my computer and waiting to be let into the exam room for my CTA oral exam. Not  how I had visualized it to be when I cleared my written exam a year ago and  started preparing for orals. COVID 19 had forced us to look at ways in which  exams could be held in online mode and the board, examiners and candidates all  came together to make it happen. In the true spirit of TA, this was an example  of exercising our Adult capacities to respond to the here and now reality of  pandemic and make different choices. </p>
                <p>So here I was with 16 other  candidates and over 50 examiners from across the world, at a big milestone in  my journey to become a therapist that started in 2013. </p>
                <p><strong>Examination process</strong></p>
                <p>Exam started with the chair of  the board welcoming me and explaining how we will work for the next hour and  fifteen mins. The board members introduced themselves and asked me to introduce  myself and the exam was on its way.</p>
                <p>My felt sense of the exam was of  a process that was safe, inviting, encouraging yet challenging. The examiners  asked questions, built upon what I shared, interacted amongst themselves on how  the process was going and enquired with me how it was going for me. Through all  this, it created a space where I felt held and secure to be able to demonstrate  my work and myself fully. The atmosphere was light but professional and at no  time did the focus deviate from the task at hand. It was a very energizing and  empowering experience and truly represented the TA Philosophy of I am Ok, U are  OK.</p>
                <p>As the board started reading out  their scores, I could feel a surge of happiness and excitement. I was eager to  finish the exam and call my supervisors and friends whom I knew were waiting  with bated breath to hear the result. </p>
                <p>There was also the virtual exam HQ where exam chairs and other  candidates were logged in to celebrate. We had a celebration with examiners and  candidates at the end of the day and even with the virtual medium, the  celebrations felt good and lots of strokes were given.</p>
                <p><strong>Pre exam</strong></p>
                <p>This was the first time that an  online exam was held. The way the exam chairs held the process built a lot of  confidence in me as a candidate. They were constantly in touch with us, sending  us details about logistics and holding a pre exam orientation to guide us  through the process and tell us how we can take care of our own process and  create a safe space for ourselves. The entire process before and during the  exam was a splendid reflection of ITAA ethical principles of protection,  empowerment, respect, responsibility and commitment. </p>
                <p>Because of the online format, I was anxious about technology playing  spoilsport and I had multiple backup plans ready in case of a technology  glitch. On the day of the exam, I started my day with doing things that helped  me be grounded and feel calm. I reminded myself that I had prepared and done  what needed to be done and now it was time to just be with the process. </p>
                <p><strong>Preparing for the exam</strong></p>
                <p>I had finished my written exam in  Jan 2020 and had started working on my orals. And it’s the process of preparing  which has been the most significant. It helped me reflect and strengthen my own  identity as a therapist. Who am I as a therapist, what motivates me to be a  therapist, what’s my work with clients, why do I work like that, what am I  drawn to and why does that appeal to me, what do I not like and why don’t I  like it – all these questions had to be answered for myself before I could  answer them for the examiners. This process helped me be grounded in my  practice. And more grounded I felt, more confident I was of what I had to do.</p>
                <p>I got a lot of support from my  colleagues, supervisors and trainers. They gave selflessly by way of reviewing  tapes, helping me with mocks, giving affirming and validating strokes and just  by being there for me. It helped to be held in such a way during the process.</p>
                <p>There were moments of feeling not confident, feeling not good enough and  doubting my own self. During my second mock exam, the examiner's feedback was  that I needed to get a different set of tapes than I had and I remember feeling  dejected and questioning if I really was ready. However, through the process,  what helped was to not lose sight of the goal and be aware of old patterns of  script and work with them and affirm new and more effective ways of being. </p>
                <p><em><strong>For all of you who are aspiring to complete your certifications, these  may be some helpful things to remember:</strong></em></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The process is more  important than the event of the exam. If you have paid attention to the  process, the outcome will follow.</li>
                  <li>As much as the process  is about doing, it's about who you are being  as a therapist that is significant. Let this be a process where you connect  with your own self and find answers to why you do what you do as a  therapist. </li>
                  <li>Make it an affirming  process by challenging your limiting beliefs</li>
                  <li>Lean in for support on  friends and colleagues</li>
                  <li>During the exam, stay  with the process and just be. (I actually had that written on a board in front  of me during the exam!). If you enjoy it and have fun, the examiners will enjoy  it too and have fun in the process.</li>
                  <li>Goes without saying,  prepare, prepare and prepare. There is no substitute for good prep.</li>
                  <li>And celebrate once you  accomplish!</li>
