                SAATA held a tribute called as &ldquo;A  Celebration of Life&rdquo; for our beloved PK Saru TSTA (PC) who was the Director of  Asha Counseling &amp; Training Services and the Managing Trustee of CHILD. Saru  worked closely with many international trainers and teachers of transactional  analysis from the time she started her TA journey. </p>
                  <p>The program for the tribute was  beautifully weaved by the SAATA BOT. There were close to 200 people who joined  the Zoom call live from many countries. Along with the live tribute, Saru&rsquo;s Facebook  page and other social media accounts were flooded with messages expressing  their condolences, grief, and some even shared their most cherished moments  spent with Saru.</p>
                  <p>The opening of the tribute was by our  current SAATA President, Ragini Rao.<br />
                    She shared a beautiful poem and a heartfelt  message about how Saru was such an important and integral part of her life. She  expressed her mixed feelings about Saru&rsquo;s loss, which makes her sad and the joy  and positivity that Saru brought in all our lives. She shared how she is  missing and remembering the smell of her perfume and the warmth of her hug.</p>
                  <p>Then there was a soulful, beautiful  rendition of a prayer song &ldquo;Maiytreem Bhajatha&rdquo; by Sai and Ragini. Attendees  were moved and felt a sense of being held in this process of grieving.</p>
                  <p>After this Suriya, Susan, and Chitra from  SAATA BOT shared their journey and memories of training with Saru. They shared  how their association with Saru was, how special Saru made each one feel, and  how she had helped them shed their inhibitions. How she  opened her heart,  and her home to all her friends. Whether the association was 27 years old or 2  years old, one thing that stood out as a theme was, how significant Saru is to  all of us and how her wisdom and her love for life has transformed and inspired  so many lives. Prathitha shared how it is so difficult to control tears. How  Saru made everyone seen and heard and gave permissions to be. For her, it was a  life before Saru and a life after Saru and it is with lot of gratitude that she  shared how Saru has been instrumental in her life.</p>
                  
                  <p>There was a presentation on Saru where her  contributions to TA and to individuals were showcased.</p>
