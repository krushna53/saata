                  <p>Heading into the writing of my TA  diploma, I was worried about my lack of understanding of the theory. When I  realised that the diploma was going about me, I was even more worried. Just  thinking about it made me wonder if I was ready to bare my soul among people I  didn't know. Eventually, I came around to the understanding that among peers  and teachers of the TA clan, we had contracted that it was a safe space, much  like our TA classes. Here, I would not be judged. This allowed a free flow of  thoughts, memories and feelings I never knew existed. As I wrote, I had several  'aha' moments leading to the theory coming alive in my own life experiences.  The revelations have created an awareness that I carry with me as I go about my  life. </p>
                  <p>And finally, the day dawned when  that much-awaited email arrived. As Murphy's Law would have it, I could see  that I had mail, but couldn't view the mail! My TA Diploma is the first I have  received since I graduated from college decades ago. Basking in the  congratulatory positive strokes took me back to that time when I was in  college. The anticipation and thrill were the same! </p>

<p>Our pictures are a true reflection of us,  as it shows us, how and who we are. Yet you know how it is sometimes when we  look at our pictures - we are surprised/unprepared. </p>
<p>I thought I was getting to know myself  better even as I was learning TA. It was instantaneous of sorts. Like taking  pictures with the digital cameras of today &amp; looking at them instantly.  When I was writing the Diploma, it was slower &amp; longer and felt similar to  the time when we would have to get a film roll developed to see the pictures.  The Diploma required me to be contemplative &amp; evaluative of myself &amp;  the changes I assumed I was already making with the awareness from TA concepts.  When I zoomed in on something specific &amp; attempted to spell out my efforts  at change, the structure of the answer compelled me to zoom out &amp; get a  panoramic view instead. It was slow going yes &amp; although the lens was  focussed on me, I found myself becoming more appreciative of some TA concepts. </p>
<p>In the end this effort gave me a picture of  myself that I was partly prepared &amp; unprepared for. Yet it was me and my  picture. And somewhere in its composition, I discovered the presence of  understanding, support &amp; appreciation which helped me see the picture for  what it is. </p>
<p>They say a picture is worth a thousand  words. It took me a couple of thousand words to get this picture of myself. And  yeah, it was worth it. </p>

<p>When I started off with writing  the diploma answers initially, there was a sense of excitement and intrigue  about penning down my interpretation of myself, intertwined with the theory  that I had been learning. Once the initial set of paragraphs were written down,  it started dawning on me that this exercise was a journey by itself. Delving  deeper into my memories from childhood, reliving some of those times, taking an  objective, third person view of myself as a child, a teenager, and as and adult  stirred up such a plethora of emotions that I found myself pausing, reliving,  sometimes even breaking down with an overwhelming feeling of sadness.</p>
<p>Over the process of writing the  answers across several months, getting more and more intense in my  self-reflection and analysis helped me understand several aspects of me that I  was either completely unaware of, or was unwilling to acknowledge. What initially  started off as a painful, and often overwhelming exercise, gradually turned  into an intriguing excursion into my persona. I could sense myself getting more  and more interested (and even excited) over time and attempted more answers  than was required for submission in the exam.</p>
<p>In the end, I was able to  appreciate the reason for the diploma exam process, the format of interspersing  theory with application and the overall thought process behind the exam  requirements. I am glad that I went through with this and had the help from my  trainer, my colleagues and my family in understanding myself better through  &lsquo;completing the task&rsquo; of writing the answers</p>

<p><strong>Vijaya:</strong> When I heard, to write one essay  question for a diploma, I thought this is about me, can it be so difficult? </p>
<p>  <strong>Ravi:</strong> Trainer commented 'Very nice flow!'  and I thought &ldquo;Oh okay! Super!&rdquo; It&rsquo;s so easy. </p>
<p>  <strong>Mathangi:</strong> I had no concept of what goes in  the essay, how to connect theory with my thought process. When I sent the first  one and the trainer said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s quite good&rdquo;. I feel like it&rsquo;s done!!! A few  days later, it came back with &ldquo;more comments&rdquo;, and then the back and forth  began </p>
<p>  <strong>Ravi:</strong> Trainer asked us to look at the  handbook, how they assess and look for consistency across all essays in terms  of content and clarity. There shouldn&rsquo;t be any conflicting information and this  is important to academic writing. </p>
<p>  <strong>Vijaya:</strong> I too thought about how to connect  concepts or retain congruence between four essays?</p>
<p>  <strong>Ravi:</strong> Initially, I thought I understood the  drama triangle; ego states I function from and how I enter and exit games. As I  wrote I recognized my patterns. I wrote interpersonal communication. Susan  said, &ldquo;very nice! Please come over&rdquo;. During discussion, I realized the essay  was an intrapsychic process. She said, this is good, <strong>just change the question!</strong></p>
<p>(All laugh)</p>
<p>  <strong>Ravi:</strong> Susan said &ldquo;you are seeing clients  why don't you write about diagnosis?&rdquo; I was like appa...how?Â  Finally, it came up well. Confidence from the  first two essays helped.</p>
<p><strong>Mathangi:</strong> Reading essays again brings  clarity, but after a couple of reads, I got tired. I remember eagerly awaiting  mail from my trainer. </p>
<p>  When the essay goes back and forth, a lot  happens within us? I wanted it to be over.</p>
<p>  <strong>Ravi:</strong> For me the Be perfect and Please  others were emerging. When my trainer was happy, I was happy.</p>
<p><strong>Mathangi:</strong> In TA, people have been on the journey  for long. In spite of the effort in showing up for weekend classes,  supervision, making the presentations; expected outcomes (Diploma, Adv.  Diploma) is not realized.Â  </p>
<p>  <strong>Ravi:</strong> They have knowledge and are  consistent in their effort. Some may be writing a draft, some could be  reviewing and stopping there. </p>
<p>  <strong>Mathangi:</strong> Perhaps essays going back and  forth is difficult? if itâ€™s one shot it will get over. </p>
<p>  <strong>Vijaya:</strong> Itâ€™s how much a person invests in  this. Writing is a journey into personal space.</p>
<p>  <strong>Ravi:</strong> Writing is commitment to self and  level of self-work is considered here.</p>
<p>  <strong>Mathangi:</strong> I think the process of waiting  for feedback is also life learning. </p>
<p>  <strong>Ravi:</strong> You learn to take feedback,  criticism, compliments.</p>
<p>  <strong>Vijaya:</strong>Â   Learning happens with writing; exams give a glimpse of who we are under  stress, what do we do which is part of our script? Do I complete what I start?</p>
<p>  <strong>Ravi:</strong> We climb one mountainâ€¦and then there  is anotherâ€¦.</p>
<p>  <strong>Vijaya: </strong>I did not consider passing an  achievement. Then I decided to ignore my marks and celebrate. Irrespective of  when and how I cross the finish line I am not going to discount my  achievements.<br />
  Silence for some time from everyoneâ€¦</p>
<p>  <strong>Mathangi:</strong> Some of the old memories I have  let go some time back returned when I started doing TA.</p>
<p>  <strong>Ravi:</strong> TA brings a lot of new things to our  consciousness.</p>

My first attempt at writing an essay was  for the question on recurring patterns, which went for a total of eleven  iterations. Each time I sent an email to my trainer, my heart would unusually  beat fast for the next few days till I received my essay back, beautifully  colored and corrected in red, yellow and green all over. Little did I realize  the truth in my trainer&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;Diploma happens when true change  happens&quot;.</p>
                  <p> One evening as I sat discussing my essay (corrections) with my  trainer, I understood the real drama and game that I was playing in my  recurring pattern. I felt like a bad person. My trainer reassured me that with  my earlier awareness, that was the best I did to protect myself and now I had a  choice, to change. Yes, I wanted to change. This helped me in writing my Part A  essay really well. The day I received my results, was a very emotional one. I  felt validated not just for my score, but for the change within, for my growth  as a person. Thank you to my trainer, for your patience and prudence in guiding  me.</p>
