              <h4><em>A Tribute to Saru by Ragini Rao, President, SAATA</em><br>
              </h4>
<p><em>On behalf of SAATA, I want to begin by  thanking everyone who has sent their condolences and kept our beloved Saru in  thoughts and prayers. Saru passed away on 25th March 2021 at the age  of 83. Thank you everyone for your countless emails, messages, and social media  posts. They have been comforting to all of us during this difficult time and  have been a reminder of the impact Saru had on so many of us.</em></p>
<p><em>It is hard to write about Saru, my guru,  whom I have known for more than 20 years and she holds a very special place in  my heart. I am honored to take this moment and share about the life of my guru,  Saru.</em></p>
<p><em>Saru was a dynamic, compassionate, and  courageous woman who lived life king size and died exactly the way she would  have wanted – while fully active and working. God blessed her with a peaceful  exit.</em></p>
<p><em>Saru was the first President of SAATA.  She was the torch bearer and led the way for many of us. She was instrumental  in establishing and growing Transactional Analysis in India. Her vision and  energy to expand this training was unmatched. She took TA to neighbouring  countries such as Bangladesh and Iran too.</em></p>
<p><em>The two most important recognitions that  Saru received that cannot be missed mentioning are -</em></p>
<p>1) Saru       received &ldquo;The Muriel James Living Principles Award&rdquo;&nbsp;in 2009, which       was established to recognize members of the ITAA who have <em>advanced       the growth of transactional analysis by personal example; as well as by       contributions of an exceptional and lasting nature. Saru demonstrated       commitment, concern, and care for both individuals and the TA community       globally. She had been active in the international advancement of the       principles of transactional analysis both professionally and personally.</em></p>
<p><em>2) Saru       received the &ldquo;SAATA Professional Excellence Award&rdquo; in 2016, which is established       to recognise individuals who have made a significant contribution to the       professional growth of transactional analysis in the South Asian region by       personal commitment and contributions of an exceptional and lasting nature       to the propagation of the vision and mission of SAATA.</em></p>
<p><em>I started my TA journey with her in 2001. Saru was my  first trainer and supervisor. Her intuitive style of teaching, along with  allowing one to learn at one&rsquo;s pace, was a highly rewarding experience for me.  I learnt many things from her, however what stood out for me is her saying –</em><br>
  <em>&ldquo;learning happens when the teacher has  conviction&rdquo;. I have often stopped to ask myself this question in my journey as  a trainer; and finding that answer has been very significant in my  effectiveness in my profession.  </em><br>
  <em>The other important message which I learnt  from her was about holding a place of abundance in every aspect of life. She  role modelled this very beautifully in the way she interacted with everybody  around her. </em></p>
<p><em>Through the years that followed our  relationship was one of colleagues and dear friends. We spent a lot of time  together in personal and professional spaces. I was lucky to accompany her to  Singapore and Bangladesh for training purposes. </em></p>
<p><em>Just as she influenced me</em><em>,  Saru managed to influence and impact hundreds of lives with her warmth,  affection and firmness. She was a perfect balance of intelligence and  intuition. She had an amazing ability to connect with people to form deep, long  lasting relationships.</em></p>
<p><em>Saru thrived and enjoyed being with  people. She had a large heart and always had something to give to people around  her and received with equal joy. She loved the attention and adulations she  received from everyone. Her spontaneity and ability to express her feelings  allowed people to relax and do the same. </em></p>
<p><em>Despite many challenges in life, Saru had  an innate capacity to move on! She believed that we can move on in life with an  attitude of generosity and gratitude. She therefore loved life and took every opportunity  to celebrate every occasion and event. Her favourite line was -  &ldquo;Only what is celebrated is sustained&rdquo;. </em><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Not Ready to Let You Go</strong><br>
  - By Kelly Roper</p>

	<div class="col-md-6">
    <p>I wish that I could tell  you<br>
  I'm not ready to let you go.<br>
  But you've already departed,<br>
  And my heart is feeling so low.</p>
<p>I miss that little twinkle<br>
  That used to light up your eyes.<br>
  And I miss the sound of your voice,<br>
  Your laughter and your sighs.</p>
<p>But most of all I miss<br>
  The way you made me feel,<br>
  Like nothing could ever harm me because<br>
  Your love was so strong and real.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
<p>There are others here who  miss you,<br>
  And they've gathered here today.<br>
  Your life touched so many people,<br>
  Who became your friends along the way.</p>
<p>They want you to know they  love you, too.<br>
  And they're filled with sadness and grief.<br>
  No one really wants to say goodbye,<br>
  So we'll just wish you eternal peace.            </p>

              <h4><em>A Tribute to Saru by Susan George, Past President, SAATA</em></h4>
              <p>Saru P. K., TSTA (P, C), passed over  peacefully four days after celebrating her birthday. She celebrated her  birthday doing an online training with her Bangalore group and with calls from  fam­ily, friends, trainees, and colleagues.</p>
              <p>Saru was born on 21 March 1938 into the  Palathumveettil family, the third daughter of Kunhamadkutty and Amina Umma. She  had a young­er sister and brother, the latter of whom was her source of  strength. His passing over a few years ago was a blow to her and also started  her thinking about death and preparing for it. She was attached to and proud of  her roots and extended family. One of the ways she showed this was a coffee  table book she put together titled <em>Tribute</em>. This 140-page book is filled  with photographs of her moth­er’s jewelry and descriptions of their design and  significance. On the day she gifted the book to me we spent nearly 3 hours with  her narrating incidents relating to the jewelry and other pleasant and not so  pleasant memories of her childhood. She said that the book had helped in  healing many parts of her script. </p>
              <p>Saru&rsquo;s life was no bed of roses. After  her divorce and one of her many operations, she got into her nephew&rsquo;s car to  enjoy fresh air as he drove down to ICTA, Kalamaserry, Kochi. This resulted in  a chance meeting with Fr. George Kandathil, who invited her to &ldquo;use your pain  to heal the pain of others.&rdquo; Thus began her journey with trans­actional analysis.  It helped her heal and also touch many lives in differ­ent ways. </p>
              <p>Saru began her first training group in  1994 at Coimbatore, where she lived in a beautiful home that now has many  memories for her trainees and trainers from other countries whom she hosted  with love. Soon after, she began a group in Chennai. Four of us passed our CTA  in 2000, and by then Saru had begun training in other cities in South India.  All her trainees unanimously agree that the person she was and the way she  bonded with each of us individually and collectively was what helped us grow  and receive many permis­sions. She used a number of sayings that still ring in  our ears, guiding and encouraging us. Many of them were put together as a  booklet titled <em>Saruisms</em>. Her commitment to ITAA and professional TA  training has led to over 20 certified members in South India, many of whom have  moved on to become PTSTAs and TSTAs. </p>
              <p>Saru also thought it her duty to uplift  people in general and Muslim women in particular. This led her to studying law  and also doing training in Iran, the Middle East, and Bang-ladesh, where she  began training in June 2003. She was proud of how they were using TA in  community work, which was reflected by the Hedges Capers Humanitarian Award  going to one of her trainees, Kursheed Erfan Ahmed. </p>
              <p>Saru enjoyed her travels to many  countries and was skilled at retain­ing connections with the numerous friends  she made. She has four sons—Manzur (<a href="manzur702@yahoo.com" target="_blank" title="manzur702@yahoo.com">manzur702@yahoo.com</a>), Riaz, Arif (<a href="padiath68@yahoo.co.in" target="_blank" title="padiath68@yahoo.co.in">padiath68@yahoo.co.in</a>), and Quasar (<a href="quasar@gmail.com" target="_blank" title="quasar@gmail.com">quasar@gmail.com</a>)—and 7 grandchildren.</p>
