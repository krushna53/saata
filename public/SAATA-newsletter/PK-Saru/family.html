              <h4 style="font-size: 17px; color: #1a6692;"><em>Saru: My aunt</em></h4><br/>
              <p>                My aunt Saru  passed away on 25th March. She had been ailing for several weeks,  but I did not expect that she would go away so soon. When the end came, it was  sudden and peaceful. I was touched by the outpouring of grief from her several  trainees and clients. She had a significant impact on the lives of so many  people.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Saru was a true  winner in the sense of Muriel James&rsquo;s definition of a winner, as a person who  makes goals and takes steps to achieve them. When she was in school, she played  the role of Rani of Jhansi in a drama. She told me that this role had a deep  impact on her, and motivated her to seek and occupy leadership positions. A  turning point in her life was the end of her second marriage. She was deeply  distressed by this unfortunate event. After the end of her first marriage, she  married her second husband much against the wishes of her family. For a few  years, she was the black sheep of the family. Saru was not a person who took  things lying down. Through persistent efforts, she managed to get herself fully  accepted in the family again. Not only that, she was also able to get her  second husband fully accepted as a member of the family. I&rsquo;ve always been  amazed by this ability she had to &lsquo;rise from the ashes&rsquo;. The end of her second  marriage was a major setback. For a while I wondered if she had lost her  phoenix-like quality. In fact, the most productive and impactful part of her  life was yet to come.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>After a while, she  pulled herself together and began to explore various productive avenues to  follow for the rest of her life. Her first mission was to get justice from her  former husband, for his unconscionable use of the &lsquo;Triple Talak&rsquo; to end her  marriage. She was fully engaged in this legal battle and was one of the first  Muslim women to obtain reasonable and fair provision for future maintenance  under The Muslim Women (Protectional Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 from the  Kerala High Court. This legal battle got her interested enough in legal issues  to obtain a law degree.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Around this time,  we were developing a TA training program as per the guidelines of the BOC of  ITAA under the guidance of Father George Kandathil SJ, TSTA at ICTA in Kochin.  I was going to Kochin to attend a meeting of people who were interested in this  TA training. Saru was travelling with me. When we got to the venue of the  meeting, I asked Saru to join me. This is how she started her TA training. The  rest as they say, is history. After she became a TA therapist and trainer, she  used to tell people that I was the one who introduced her to TA. Well, this is  the extent of my introduction.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>When I introduce  myself to people at workshops, they often tell me, &ldquo;Oh, so you are the one who  brought Saru to TA&rdquo;. I used to reply that all that I did was travel in the same  car going to the first meeting. In those early days, we used to travel every  month to Kochin for the weekend training groups. Saru was able to work through  many of her personal issues during these training groups. Her analysis of the  trajectory of her life and its possibilities for the future not only made her a  winner but also developed in her deep insights in Scripts and Script analysis.  I have heard from her trainees that Script analysis was one of her powerful  therapeutic interventions.<br>
                Saru appeared for  the CTA exams during the International TA Conference at Kochin in 1993. Sister  Annie and I had appeared for the CTA exam in Stamford in 1991. Sister Annie  passed, but I was deferred. All ICTA trainees appeared for the CTA exam at  Kochin. Saru was very confident that she would pass. I was cautious and told  her not to be overconfident. She said that she knew how to manage the  examination board and that she would pass. And indeed, she did. As did all the  other ICTA trainees. Saru was very confident of her &lsquo;use of self&rsquo;.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Subsequently. Saru  started CHILD and ASHA. Her trust and counselling centre respectively, in  Coimbatore. She had training groups in Coimbatore, Bangalore and Mumbai in  India and in Bangladesh and Iran. She may be the most well-known face of TA in  India.Â  </p>
