Depression Research

Under the guidance of Mark Widdowson, seven researchers in India and engaged in case study research. Each of the researchers is working with a single client, studying and documenting the impact of Transactional Analysis interventions on the healing of depression. Three supervisors who are involved in the project are Susan George, Ragini Rao and Annie Cariappa

Workshop: Measuring My Work

Aruna Gopakumar, Nisha Rao and Shrutkirti Singh did a workshop on Measuring my Work to invite TA practitioners to integrate research into their work. The workshop was help online on October 6th, 2021. In this crisp 3 hour learning module, attendees understood the basics of a research mindset to measure effectiveness of TA interventions across all 4 fields of application.

In a survey conducted by SAATA in August 2021 to analyse how practitioners measure and analyse their interventions, we found that 95% respondents rely on verbal feedback from clients and 88% see positive shifts in clients as measures of success. The need for scientific qualitative and quantitative data collection through relevant tools and documentation is clearly apparent. This workshop was a step in this direction.

The workshop started with the participants being introduced to the Mark Widdowson’s protocol for depression research. Participants were excited to learn how outcome measures could be used to scientifically measure the impact of their work. They also learnt about the rigour that was needed in the documentation and review of their work, for the case study to be accepted in a scientific publication. The presenters then introduced them briefly to the basics of research – that included types of research and the elements that they needed to think about. For example, research question, research design and methodology. Examples of research from Psychotherapy, Organisational and Educational fields were shared to show possible research designs in all fields.

The workshop then demonstrated the process of searching and identifying outcome measures and shared websites like inn.theorizeit and google scholar to enable participants to explore articles for their own research. Specifically, participant ideas were used to demonstrate how to identify variables from constructs and search, review existing articles to spot options of tools and instruments, and check the quality and other essential details of a tool.

Finally a participant shared a research idea and worked through it in live supervision, allowing participants to witness how they could conceptualise their own research. As mentioned by a participant, the workshop provided them a glimpse of the 'scientist-practitioner model'.
